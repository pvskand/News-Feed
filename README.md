# News-Feed
A chrome extension to have a quick look at the latest news. This extension uses [News API](https://newsapi.org) which is a free API and gives news from around 70+ sources.
I have currently used only The Hindu as the source. 

# Improvements and further planning
A lot can be improved in this extension. This is a simple chrome extension.
The improvements can be in:<br />
1) Allowing user to select the type of news he wants.<br />
2) Showing the number of unread latest news on the extension icon.

If you feel that you can contribute to this extension the do create an issue [here](https://github.com/pvskand/News-Feed/issues) first and then make a PR.
